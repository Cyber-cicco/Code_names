# Code_names

Source code of a website you can install on your personnal webserver to play the game "codenames".

The server has to run PHP in order for the website to work.

Just copy and paste the files on your webserver, enter the IP adress of your personal webserver on your phone 
(it has to be in the same network as your webserver), and you'll be connected to the website.

As for now, you can't add a group thrue the website, you need to change the XML files in order to create your own group.

The game is also in french.
